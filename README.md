# Lichess-API-Auto-Best-Move-Python3
Uses the Lichess API and Stockfish to play the best move if you run the code.

Make sure to set your username and the secret token (game:play). 
You also need to install Stockfish (https://stockfishchess.org/) and set the path to the executable.
Thats everything.
